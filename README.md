# Welcome!

This portfolio is where I host my personal projects, current tech stack, and CV.

## About the site
This portfolio was built using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses Webpack for the build, EmailJS for handling the contact form, and is deployed using Firebase.

It has been through many iterations (including a brief dalliance with Handlebars), and will probably remain fairly static in terms of design from here on.

The projects will be updated fairly regularly, though depending on what I'm learning and practicing, not all projects will be shown here.

## Main next steps
- Improve mobile responsiveness.
- Add more projects! Particularly larger-scale ones that solve real business problems.
- Create or integrate a blog.

## Keen to reach out?
There's a contact form on the site, but you're also very welcome to [add me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-meadows/) and send me a message.

If you have feedback on my code, a question about a project, or are interested in working together, I'm always happy to talk.
